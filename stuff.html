STARTING A NEW OFFICE? THESE
CITIES GIVE YOU THE MOST ENGINEERING
BANG FOR YOUR BUCK:
While job seekers are particularly interested in their potential
salaries, employers can use average salary data to scale their
teams. If you’ve got a $1M annual engineering budget, you
can hire approximately 10 engineers in Atlanta, compared to
9 in Boston or just 8 in San Francisco.
MID-SIZED COMPANIES OFFER HIGHEST SALARIES:
Our data shows that salary and number of employees are positively correlated until we reach the 201-500
employee mark, and then the numbers start to go back down. One possible reason for this is the availability of
salary alternatives as part of an overall compensation package. For example, companies with less than 200
people are usually in the series b or below stage, and can offer more equity, whereas many companies with more
than 500 people are publicly traded and can offer stock packages. Those in the middle have less equity to give
and typically aren’t publicly traded, so higher salaries may be a way to keep offers competitive.
