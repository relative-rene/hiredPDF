Beyond pdf

https://relative-rene.github.io/hiredPDF/


Turned a PDF into a mobile friendly website. Used Materialize responsive library.

Issue:
1. Materialize does not respond on Github pages.
2. I byspassed the wireframing process and the transfering of actual content became a big time suck. NEVER COPY CUT AND PASTE the whole doc. Lessoned learned, don't skip steps

Future development:
nothing.
If I could have more time, I would fix the visual hiearchy. More interacting features.
