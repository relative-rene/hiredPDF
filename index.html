    <h5> HIRED’S STATE OF SALARIES REPORT</h5>
    <hr>
    <p>Hired, the company on a mission to get everyone a job they love, has tapped into its
data to reveal insights on software engineers’ salaries and the hiring market more
generally. Because Hired facilitates the job searching process from the initial interview
request all the way to the final job offer, we have unprecedented visibility into salaries
across a variety of positions and companies. Most of the tools available to companies
and job seekers are flawed and inaccurate. Salary calculators don’t account for
company size, years of candidate experience or location, while many job sites are
based on anonymous, self-reported data which can vary widely in accuracy. Hired’s
data, on the other hand, is based on actual job offers made to real people.
Our inaugural State of Salaries report is part of a larger effort to bring more
transparency to the hiring process. We want to empower candidates to understand
their market value based on their skills and experience so that they can approach the
job searching process armed with information. We also want to help companies
recruit and hire with insight. We believe this transparency benefits everyone, so that
individuals can find jobs they love and companies can attract the individuals who will
drive their businesses forward.</p>

<h4>WHERE DOES YOUR SOFTWARE
ENGINEERING PAYCHECK GO THE
FURTHEST?
</h4>
<p>San Francisco is infamous for high salaries and
even higher rents. While San Francisco salaries
are huge - $132K on average for software
engineers - adjusting for cost of living paints a
different picture. We used a standardized cost of
living calculator to show how average salaries in
each city would compare to San Francisco.
For example, an engineer in Austin making
$110,000 would need to make $195,000 in San
Francisco to maintain the same quality of life.
While it’s easy for job seekers to get stars in their
eyes over the salaries in San Francisco, when you
adjust for cost of living, an engineer’s salary goes
further in every city in our analysis with the
exception of New York.
