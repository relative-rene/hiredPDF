    <h5> HIRED’S STATE OF SALARIES REPORT</h5>
    <hr>
    <p>Hired, the company on a mission to get everyone a job they love, has tapped into its
data to reveal insights on software engineers’ salaries and the hiring market more
generally. Because Hired facilitates the job searching process from the initial interview
request all the way to the final job offer, we have unprecedented visibility into salaries
across a variety of positions and companies. Most of the tools available to companies
and job seekers are flawed and inaccurate. Salary calculators don’t account for
company size, years of candidate experience or location, while many job sites are
based on anonymous, self-reported data which can vary widely in accuracy. Hired’s
data, on the other hand, is based on actual job offers made to real people.
Our inaugural State of Salaries report is part of a larger effort to bring more
transparency to the hiring process. We want to empower candidates to understand
their market value based on their skills and experience so that they can approach the
job searching process armed with information. We also want to help companies
recruit and hire with insight. We believe this transparency benefits everyone, so that
individuals can find jobs they love and companies can attract the individuals who will
drive their businesses forward.</p>

<h4>WHERE DOES YOUR SOFTWARE
ENGINEERING PAYCHECK GO THE
FURTHEST?
</h4>
<p>San Francisco is infamous for high salaries and
even higher rents. While San Francisco salaries
are huge - $132K on average for software
engineers - adjusting for cost of living paints a
different picture. We used a standardized cost of
living calculator to show how average salaries in
each city would compare to San Francisco.
For example, an engineer in Austin making
$110,000 would need to make $195,000 in San
Francisco to maintain the same quality of life.
While it’s easy for job seekers to get stars in their
eyes over the salaries in San Francisco, when you
adjust for cost of living, an engineer’s salary goes
further in every city in our analysis with the
exception of New York.

<li>DENVER: $180K</li>
<li>ATLANTA: $163K</li>

    <h4>STARTING A CAREER?
    DO IT IN SAN FRANCISCO.</h4>
    <p>Forgetting cost-of-living adjustments
    for a moment, our data indicates that
    there are advantages to starting your
    career in San Francisco. Candidates
    leaving the Bay Area command
    higher offers than candidates from
    any other city in our analysis.
    <span id="sf-bottom">Bottom line: No matter where you
    want to work, engineers that start
    their careers in San Francisco have
    a higher earning potential once they
    move to other job markets.</span></p>

  <h5>TRANSPLANTS VS. LOCALS: HOW DO SALARY OFFERS COMPARE?</h5>
  <p>In most cities, companies offer higher salaries to candidates who are relocating from another market. The only
  exception is San Francisco, where local candidates command higher salaries than those relocating from outside
  the Bay Area.</p>

  <h5>STARTING A NEW OFFICE? THESE
  CITIES GIVE YOU THE MOST ENGINEERING
  BANG FOR YOUR BUCK:<h5>
  While job seekers are particularly interested in their potential
  salaries, employers can use average salary data to scale their
  teams. If you’ve got a $1M annual engineering budget, you
  can hire approximately 10 engineers in Atlanta, compared to
  9 in Boston or just 8 in San Francisco.
  <hr>
  MID-SIZED COMPANIES OFFER HIGHEST SALARIES:
  Our data shows that salary and number of employees are positively correlated until we reach the 201-500
  employee mark, and then the numbers start to go back down. One possible reason for this is the availability of
  salary alternatives as part of an overall compensation package. For example, companies with less than 200
  people are usually in the series b or below stage, and can offer more equity, whereas many companies with more
  than 500 people are publicly traded and can offer stock packages. Those in the middle have less equity to give
  and typically aren’t publicly traded, so higher salaries may be a way to keep offers competitive.
