          <p class="topic"> HIRED’S STATE OF SALARIES REPORT</p>
          <p>
            Hired, the company on a mission to get everyone a job they love, has tapped into its
            data to reveal insights on software engineers’ salaries and the hiring market more
            generally. Because Hired facilitates the job searching process from the initial interview
            request all the way to the final job offer, we have unprecedented visibility into salaries
            across a variety of positions and companies. Most of the tools available to companies
            and job seekers are flawed and inaccurate. Salary calculators don’t account for
            company size, years of candidate experience or location, while many job sites are
            based on anonymous, self-reported data which can vary widely in accuracy. Hired’s
            data, on the other hand, is based on actual job offers made to real people.
            <br>
            Our inaugural State of Salaries report is part of a larger effort to bring more
            transparency to the hiring process. We want to empower candidates to understand
            their market value based on their skills and experience so that they can approach the
            job searching process armed with information. We also want to help companies
            recruit and hire with insight. We believe this transparency benefits everyone, so that
            individuals can find jobs they love and companies can attract the individuals who will
            drive their businesses forward.

            <p class="topic">WHERE DOES YOUR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PAYCHECK GO THE FURTHEST?</p>
            <p>
              San Francisco is infamous for high salaries and
              even higher rents. While San Francisco salaries
              are huge - $132K on average for software
              engineers - adjusting for cost of living paints a
              different picture. We used a standardized cost of
              living calculator to show how average salaries in
              each city would compare to San Francisco.
              For example, an engineer in Austin making
              $110,000 would need to make $195,000 in San
              Francisco to maintain the same quality of life.
              While it’s easy for job seekers to get stars in their
              eyes over the salaries in San Francisco, when you
              adjust for cost of living, an engineer’s salary goes
              further in every city in our analysis with the
              exception of New York.

                In most cities, companies offer higher salaries to candidates who are relocating from another market. The only

                While job seekers are particularly interested in their potential salaries,
                employers can use average salary data to scale their teams. If you’ve got
                a $1M annual engineering budget, you can hire approximately 10 engineers
                in Atlanta, compared to 9 in Boston or just 8 in San Francisco.

              <p>
                Our data shows that salary and number of employees are positively correlated until we reach the 201-500
                employee mark, and then the numbers start to go back down. One possible reason for this is the availability of
                salary alternatives as part of an overall compensation package. For example, companies with less than 200
                people are usually in the series b or below stage, and can offer more equity, whereas many companies with more
                than 500 people are publicly traded and can offer stock packages. Those in the middle have less equity to give
                and typically aren’t publicly traded, so higher salaries may be a way to keep offers competitive.

                requests and job offers from the past year facilitated through our marketplace of
